UltimatePlugin
==============
by tonykaram1993

NOTE: this plugin is still in beta and testing is in process. However because it is a very big plugin, and plus the fact that I do not have access to an online server, some things cannot be tested. I would appreciate if you tested it and report any problem or things that needs fixing.

We all know the famous amx_super plugin. Most servers use it as a wonderful
administrative tool to let admins take control over their servers and manage
it in a better and more efficient way. At first I started by editing that
plugin to make it use less resources and do things in a better way (AFAIK).
But later, I ended up rewriting the whole thing from scratch (ofc it is based
on amx_super so a lot of resemblance can be found). I hope I succeeded in
my mition. I am not the best coder there is, but I think I have some good
knowledge in scripting (I hope).
